# Spatial-Audio-in-Virtual-Reality

A four-month-long project carried out at Aalborg University Copenhagen.
Our goal was to create an interface for mixing 3D sound in virtual realityâ€”using dynamic binaural audio. 
We used Max/MSP for implementing spatial audio and Unity for the environment. 
The application was running on an Oculus Quest VR headset.
